Project by Sourabh Kumar Dubey ITCS 5154 (id- 801429834)


How it works :

Enter Id and Enter Name. After enter name and id. 
Click Take Images button. 
The camera of your device takes around 60 images which is used for training the model.
Training phase is done. 
By clicking on Track Image button, video streaming starts. 
If face is recognised by system then Id and Name of person is shown on Image. 
Attendance of person will be stored in Attendance folder as csv file with name, id, date and time.
